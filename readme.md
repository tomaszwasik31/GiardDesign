# Giard Design - Modern Garden Design Portfolio (AdRespect Recruitment Task)

Welcome to the Giard Design GitHub repository! This project is part of my recruitment task for AdRespect. The repository showcases the code for the Giard Design website, a portfolio that demonstrates my skills in using HTML, CSS (specifically Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. While the project is not pixel-perfect, it provides a solid foundation and serves as a good starting point for showcasing my abilities.

- **Innovative Grid System:** This project showcases my introduction to grid systems for designing complex layouts effectively.
- **Tailwind Elements:** The 'Tailwind Elements' library enhances the visual and interactive elements of the website, providing a polished user experience.
